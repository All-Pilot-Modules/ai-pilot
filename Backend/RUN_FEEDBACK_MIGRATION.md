# AI Feedback Without Correct Answer - Migration Guide

## What Changed

The AI feedback system now provides feedback **even when no correct answer is set** for a question. This is useful for:
- Open-ended questions
- Questions still being configured
- Scenarios where correctness isn't binary

## Changes Made

### 1. Backend Service (`app/services/ai_feedback.py`)
- Removed the error when correct answer is missing
- Set `is_correct = None` when no correct answer available
- Logs warning instead of failing

### 2. Prompt Builder (`app/services/prompt_builder.py`)
- Updated to handle `is_correct = None`
- Generates different prompts for unknown correctness
- AI provides general analysis instead of right/wrong feedback

### 3. Database Model (`app/models/ai_feedback.py`)
- `is_correct` field now **nullable** (Boolean → Boolean or NULL)
- `score` field now **nullable** (Integer → Integer or NULL)

### 4. Database Schema (migration required)
- Modified `ai_feedback` table columns to allow NULL

## How to Run Migration

**Run this SQL in your database:**

```bash
psql $DATABASE_URL -f migration_nullable_feedback.sql
```

**Or copy/paste this SQL:**

```sql
-- Make is_correct and score nullable
ALTER TABLE ai_feedback ALTER COLUMN is_correct DROP NOT NULL;
ALTER TABLE ai_feedback ALTER COLUMN score DROP NOT NULL;
```

## Verification

After migration, check the columns:

```sql
SELECT column_name, data_type, is_nullable
FROM information_schema.columns
WHERE table_name = 'ai_feedback'
  AND column_name IN ('is_correct', 'score');
```

Expected output:
```
 column_name  | data_type | is_nullable
--------------+-----------+-------------
 is_correct   | boolean   | YES
 score        | integer   | YES
```

## How It Works Now

### With Correct Answer Set:
```
Student Answer: C
Correct Answer: A
is_correct: false
score: 0
feedback: "Your answer is incorrect. Think about..."
```

### Without Correct Answer Set:
```
Student Answer: C
Correct Answer: (not set)
is_correct: null
score: null
feedback: "Let's analyze your reasoning. You chose C which suggests..."
```

## Testing

1. Run the migration
2. Restart your backend: `uvicorn main:app --reload`
3. Submit an answer to the question missing correct answer (ID: `6b9dedc6-49d7-4dcb-b033-a0c3595f7ad0`)
4. Check the feedback - it should generate successfully with `null` for is_correct/score

## Production Ready ✅

This change is backward compatible:
- Existing feedback with correct answers works the same
- New feedback without correct answers now works too
- Frontend displays both cases correctly
