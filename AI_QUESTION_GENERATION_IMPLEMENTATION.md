# AI Question Generation Feature - Implementation Complete

## Overview
Successfully implemented an AI-powered question generation feature that allows teachers to automatically generate questions from their uploaded documents. Questions are generated using OpenAI GPT models, saved with "unreviewed" status, and require teacher approval before becoming visible to students.

---

## Features Implemented

### Backend (Python/FastAPI)

#### 1. Database Schema (`migration_add_question_status.sql`)
- Added `status` column to track question review state (unreviewed, active, archived)
- Added `is_ai_generated` boolean flag
- Added `generated_at` timestamp
- Created indexes for efficient filtering

#### 2. Models Updated
- **`Question` model** (`Backend/app/models/question.py`):
  - Added `QuestionStatus` class with constants
  - Added new fields: status, is_ai_generated, generated_at
  - Added indexes for status-based queries

#### 3. Schemas Updated (`Backend/app/schemas/question.py`)
- Added new request/response schemas:
  - `QuestionGenerationRequest` - specify question counts
  - `QuestionGenerationResponse` - generation result
  - `BulkApproveRequest` - approve multiple questions
  - `BulkApproveResponse` - bulk operation result
- Updated existing schemas to include new fields

#### 4. Question Generation Service (`Backend/app/services/question_generation.py`)
- **Core Logic**:
  - Fetches RAG-processed document chunks from database
  - Constructs intelligent OpenAI prompt with document content
  - Generates questions using GPT-4/GPT-4o-mini
  - Parses JSON response into structured format
  - Returns questions ready for database insertion
- **Features**:
  - Smart content formatting (preserves page/slide context)
  - Pedagogically sound question generation
  - Bloom's taxonomy classification
  - Learning outcome identification
  - MCQ with 4 options and correct answer validation

#### 5. API Endpoints Added

**Document Routes** (`Backend/app/api/routes/document.py`):
```
POST /api/documents/{doc_id}/generate-questions
- Validates document is RAG-indexed
- Generates questions and saves to DB with status='unreviewed'
- Returns generation stats and review URL
```

**Question Routes** (`Backend/app/api/routes/question.py`):
```
PUT /api/questions/{question_id}/approve
- Approves single question (changes status to 'active')

POST /api/questions/bulk-approve
- Approves multiple questions at once

GET /api/questions/by-module?module_id={id}&status={status}
- Fetch questions filtered by status

GET /api/questions/status/{status}?module_id={id}
- Get all questions with specific status
```

#### 6. CRUD Functions (`Backend/app/crud/question.py`)
- `get_questions_by_status()` - filter questions by status
- `approve_question()` - approve single question
- `bulk_approve_questions()` - approve multiple questions

---

### Frontend (Next.js/React)

#### 1. Documents Page Updates (`Frontend/app/dashboard/documents/page.js`)
- **AI Generate Button**:
  - Only visible on RAG-indexed documents (embedded/indexed status)
  - Purple sparkle icon for visual distinction
  - Opens generation modal on click

- **Generation Modal**:
  - Input fields for short answer, long answer, and MCQ counts
  - Real-time total calculation
  - Validation (min 1, max 100 total)
  - Loading state during generation
  - Auto-redirects to review page on success

#### 2. Question Review Page (`Frontend/app/dashboard/questions/review/page.js`)
- **Features**:
  - Displays all unreviewed questions for a module
  - Checkbox selection for bulk operations
  - Individual question actions:
    - ✅ Approve - changes status to active
    - ✏️ Edit - inline editing with auto-approve
    - 🗑️ Delete - removes question
  - Bulk approve selected questions
  - Question type badges (MCQ, Short, Long)
  - Shows correct answers for MCQs
  - Learning outcome display
  - Empty state when all reviewed

---

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Run Database Migration

```bash
cd Backend
psql -U your_username -d your_database -f migration_add_question_status.sql
```

Or use your ORM migration tool if available.

### 2. Verify OpenAI API Key

Ensure `OPENAI_API_KEY` is set in `Backend/.env`:
```env
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
LLM_MODEL=gpt-4o-mini  # or gpt-4 for better quality
```

### 3. Restart Backend Server

```bash
cd Backend
python main.py
```

### 4. Restart Frontend Server

```bash
cd Frontend
npm run dev
```

## How It Works - User Flow

### Teacher Workflow

1. **Upload Document**
   - Teacher uploads a document (PDF, DOCX, PPTX)
   - System processes document through RAG pipeline
   - Document status changes to "embedded" or "indexed"

2. **Generate Questions**
   - Teacher navigates to Documents page
   - Sees "AI Generate" button on indexed documents
   - Clicks button and specifies question quantities:
     - Short Answer: 5
     - Long Answer: 3
     - Multiple Choice: 10
   - Clicks "Generate Questions"

3. **AI Processing** (10-30 seconds)
   - Backend fetches document chunks
   - Constructs OpenAI prompt
   - GPT generates 18 questions
   - Questions saved to DB with status="unreviewed"
   - Teacher redirected to review page

4. **Review & Approve**
   - Teacher sees all 18 generated questions
   - Can perform actions on each:
     - **Approve** - Makes question visible to students
     - **Edit** - Modify question text/options, auto-approves
     - **Delete** - Removes poor quality questions
   - Can select multiple and bulk approve
   - Questions remain in "unreviewed" list until actioned

5. **Student View**
   - Students ONLY see questions with status="active"
   - Unreviewed questions are completely hidden
   - No risk of showing unverified content to students

## Technical Details

### Question Generation Prompt Strategy

The service constructs an intelligent prompt that:
- Includes full document content with page/slide context
- Specifies exact question counts and types
- Requests learning outcomes and Bloom's taxonomy levels
- Enforces JSON response format for reliable parsing
- Ensures pedagogical soundness and diversity

### Data Source: RAG Chunks (Not Raw Documents)

**Why RAG Chunks?**
- ✅ Content already cleaned (no headers/footers)
- ✅ Faster processing (chunks pre-extracted)
- ✅ Lower OpenAI costs (less redundant text)
- ✅ Better quality (focused on key content)
- ✅ Consistent with "RAG-indexed" requirement

### Status-Based Workflow Benefits

**Why Database Storage (Not In-Memory)?**
- ✅ No data loss on browser crash
- ✅ Teachers can review in multiple sessions
- ✅ Handles large question sets (100+)
- ✅ Audit trail of AI-generated questions
- ✅ Enables "Pending Review" counts in UI

## Troubleshooting

### "Document not RAG-indexed" Error
- **Cause**: Document hasn't been processed yet
- **Solution**: Wait for document to reach "embedded" or "indexed" status

### "Failed to generate questions" Error
- **Cause**: OpenAI API error or rate limit
- **Solution**: Check API key, verify OpenAI account has credits

### Questions not appearing for students
- **Cause**: Questions still have status="unreviewed"
- **Solution**: Approve questions on review page first

### Slow generation (>1 minute)
- **Cause**: Large documents with many chunks
- **Solution**: Normal for 100+ page documents, consider reducing question count

---

## Success Criteria ✅

All requirements have been successfully implemented:

- ✅ Button on documents page for AI question generation
- ✅ Only visible on RAG-indexed documents
- ✅ Modal to specify question types and quantities
- ✅ AI generates questions from document content
- ✅ Questions saved to database with "unreviewed" status
- ✅ Dedicated review page for teacher approval
- ✅ Teachers can approve, edit, or delete questions
- ✅ Students only see approved questions
- ✅ No data loss (database-backed workflow)
- ✅ Scalable (handles 100+ questions)
- ✅ Cost-effective (uses RAG chunks, not raw documents)

---

## Conclusion

The AI Question Generation feature is fully implemented and ready for testing. Teachers can now generate high-quality assessment questions from their documents with minimal effort, while maintaining full control over what students see.

**Next Steps:**
1. Run the database migration
2. Test with a sample document
3. Generate some questions
4. Review and approve them
5. Verify students see only approved questions

Happy question generating! 🎉
