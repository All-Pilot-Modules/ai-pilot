## How AI Feedback Works

### The Process

1. **Student submits answer** to a question
2. **System analyzes** answer against:
   - Correct answer/expected response
   - Grading rubric (if applicable)
   - Question context and learning objectives
3. **AI generates feedback** including:
   - Correctness assessment
   - Strengths in the answer
   - Areas for improvement
   - Specific suggestions
   - Score/grade (for rubric-based)
4. **Student receives feedback** immediately or after review

### AI Model

**Default Model**: GPT-4
**Alternative**: GPT-3.5-turbo (faster, lower cost)

**Model Selection**:
```env
# Backend/.env
OPENAI_MODEL=gpt-4  # or gpt-3.5-turbo
```

### Data Privacy

## Types of AI Feedback

### 1. Multiple Choice Feedback

**When answer is correct**:
```
✅ Correct!

Your answer "C" is correct. This demonstrates understanding
of the binary search algorithm's time complexity.

Key concept: Binary search halves the search space in each
iteration, resulting in O(log n) complexity.
```

**When answer is incorrect**:
```
❌ Not quite.

You selected "A" (O(n²)), but the correct answer is "C" (O(log n)).

Why this is important:
Binary search is much more efficient than linear search because
it repeatedly divides the search interval in half.

Review: Section 4.2 on algorithm complexity
```

### 2. True/False Feedback

```
❌ Incorrect.

The statement "Python is a compiled language" is False.

Explanation:
Python is an interpreted language, meaning code is executed
line-by-line by the Python interpreter rather than being
compiled to machine code beforehand.

However, Python does use bytecode compilation as an intermediate
step, which might cause confusion.

```

### 3. Short Answer Feedback

**Student answer**: "Photosynthesis is when plants make food from the sun."

**AI Feedback**:
```
Score: 7/10

Strengths:
✓ Correctly identified the basic process
✓ Mentioned the sun as energy source

Areas for improvement:
• Include the specific inputs (CO₂ and water)
• Mention the outputs (glucose and oxygen)
• Use scientific terminology

More complete answer:
"Photosynthesis is the process by which plants use light energy
to convert carbon dioxide and water into glucose (food) and
oxygen."

Great start! Review the chemical equation in your notes.
```

### 4. Essay Feedback
