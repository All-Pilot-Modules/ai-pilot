- 2 CPU cores
- 4 GB RAM
- 10 GB storage

**Recommended**:
- 4+ CPU cores
- 8+ GB RAM
- 20+ GB SSD storage

See [Installation Guide](Installation) for details.

### Do I need an OpenAI API key?

Yes, for AI features like:
- AI-generated feedback
- Test question suggestions
- Analytics insights
- Document Q&A (RAG)

Basic features work without an API key.

### What database is used?

PostgreSQL 15+ is the primary database. It stores:
- User accounts
- Modules and tests
- Student responses
- Analytics data

### Can I use a different AI provider?

Currently, the system is built for OpenAI's API. However, you can modify the code to support:
- Anthropic Claude
- Google PaLM
- Open-source models (LLaMA, Mistral)

### Is there a mobile app?

Not yet, but the web interface is fully responsive and works on:
- Mobile browsers
- Tablets
- Desktop

## Security & Privacy

### How is student data protected?

- Passwords are hashed with bcrypt
- JWT tokens for authentication
- HTTPS encryption (in production)
- Role-based access control
- Database encryption at rest

### Is data shared with third parties?

No. Your data stays on your server. OpenAI processes text for AI features but doesn't store it (per their policy).

### Can I export my data?

Yes! You can export:
- Student lists (CSV, JSON)
- Test results (CSV, JSON)
- Analytics reports (CSV, PDF)
- All module data

### Is it FERPA compliant?

The system provides the tools for FERPA compliance, but you're responsible for:
- Proper deployment security
- Access controls
- Data handling policies
- Privacy notices

## Usage & Administration

### How many students can I have?

There's no hard limit. Performance depends on your server resources. Typical deployments handle:
- Small: 1-100 students
- Medium: 100-1,000 students
- Large: 1,000+ students (requires scaling)

### Can multiple teachers use the same instance?

Yes! Each teacher has their own account and modules. Students can be enrolled in multiple modules.

### How do I back up my data?

**Database backup**:
```bash
pg_dump ai_pilot > backup.sql
```

**Restore**:
```bash
psql ai_pilot < backup.sql
```

See [Backup Guide](Backup-and-Restore) for details.

### Can I migrate from another LMS?

We're working on import tools. Currently, you can:
- Manually recreate modules
- Import student lists via CSV
- Import questions (with custom scripts)

## Troubleshooting

### Students can't join my module

**Check**:
- Access code is correct (6 digits)
- Module is active
- Server is running
- No firewall blocking access

### AI feedback isn't working

**Verify**:
- OpenAI API key is set in `.env`
- API key is valid and has credits
- Backend server is running
- Check backend logs for errors

### Analytics not showing

**Common causes**:
- No student data yet
- Database connection issues
- Frontend can't reach backend API
- Check browser console for errors

### Upload fails

**Solutions**:
- Check file size limit (default 10MB)
- Verify file format is supported
- Ensure upload directory has write permissions
- Check backend logs
